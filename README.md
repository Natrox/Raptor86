Raptor86
========

A toy virtual machine based on the x86-87 instruction set made in my spare time.


Documentation
=============

A formal documentation has not been written yet.

For unassembled versions of programs, check the "assembler" folder.

For the VM binary and compiled programs, check the "bin" folder.

For the source, check the "src" folder for a VS2012 project file and code files.

SDL has been included to create a surface as video output for the Raptor86. SDL is not tied to the project, you may use any video output system. The virtual machine can also run without video output.
